### High Concept

As clearly and simply as you can, explain your game idea.

### Theme

Your game must adhere to the following theme: **Take One, Leave The Rest**

    - The theme/setting/scenario/mechanic of your game must be something that involves this theme.


Explain how your game idea works with the theme.

### Mock Ups

Create a visual flow of the User Experience (How will people interact with the program and what will they see when doing so?)

Visually draw out things like Main Menu, Credits, Options, Play etc...

Provide a rough drawing of what the play scene(s) look like. How is it organized? What is the User Interface? How do players interact with the game?

We are looking for rough sketches, flow charts and concept images.
